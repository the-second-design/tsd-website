If you ask most college students what they plan to do with their future, a familiar silence follows.  

Not because they lack ambition, but because very few have received guidance on how to think about their life, their career, or even their own potential in a structured way.

This is the exact gap [**Real World Ready**](http://theseconddesign.com/real-world-ready) was built to solve.

## What is Real World Ready?

Real World Ready is not a “course”. It’s not another motivational talk.

It is a **training ground for mindset, agency and real-world thinking**.

At its core is a simple loop:

**Do → Get Feedback → Iterate.**

We call this **meta-learning**. It’s the idea that if you can act, gather feedback, and improve deliberately, you can learn almost anything you need, at any point in life.

We package this loop into sessions on topics students are seeking help with, such as:

- **Shitty First Drafts** – how to start imperfectly and defeat perfectionism 
- **Understanding Agency** – how to create opportunities for yourself  
- **Agency in Action** – how to design a career that works for you  
- **Navigating Your Future** – how to think about uncertainty and long-term plans  
- **Understanding System Design** – how to see life and career as a system, not a collection of random events  

When we partnered with TinkerHub, this philosophy finally found the right audience at scale - curious, ambitious students who were already leaning into learning, but needed structure and a mindset shift to go further. This is the story of how that partnershipt grew into **Beyond the Blueprint**, a co-branded learning experience created in partnership with **TinkerHub Foundation**, reaching students across Kerala - first online, then in Kochi.

## How “Beyond the Blueprint” Came to Life

TinkerHub’s mission has always been clear: Help students in Kerala become makers, problem-solvers, and independent thinkers.

Real World Ready’s mission complements it: Give students the **mental tools, structure, and confidence** to become world-class contributors.

In July 2024, we decided to run an experiment together. The first online session happened on **20 August 2024**.

We expected a good session.  
What we got instead was a signal.

Students who were used to one-way talks walked into something very different:

- Workbooks open, pages filling up with thoughts, fears, plans  
- Breakout rooms where strangers from different colleges were suddenly solving problems together  
- A lot of awkward silence at the start – which gradually turned into honest conversations  

Very quickly, this experiment started to look like the early version of a new kind of ongoing program. That’s when we named it:

**Beyond the Blueprint** — a series of highly interactive, real-world sessions by **TinkerHub** and **The Second Design**.

## What Students Actually Said

The best measure of whether this was working didn’t come from us. It came from the students.

From the very first sessions on **Developing Agency**, we started getting messages like these:

> “The workshop was a truly engaging and enriching experience. The sessions were both enjoyable and insightful… I appreciated how the workshop helped us understand that every problem has various solutions and that thinking differently can lead to creative and effective outcomes.”  
> — *Nahidah, Jyothi Engineering College, Shornur*

> “I thoroughly enjoyed the workshop experience! The makers were exceptional… The interactive format kept me engaged, and the accompanying workbook made it even better.”  
> — *Muhammed Shan, College of Engineering, Perumon*

#### 🎥 A Student Story: Achuth S. Pai

> “It was like one of those conclusions you reach from overthinking, that you forget over time, so you need a memory boost to remind yourself what you have to do… I believe the little time spent has in fact started a butterfly effect chain reaction for me.”  
> — *Harikrishnan, College of Engineering, Perumon*

> “The interactive and practical nature of the discussion made it particularly engaging, especially about the mindsets. I found the topic on agency thinking and mindset especially insightful, as it made me reflect on past mistakes and helped me to reflect myself.”  
> — *Aaron, College of Engineering, Karunagappally*

These weren’t “nice session, thanks” comments. These were students processing something real - mindsets shifting, language for their own problems emerging, and a new way of thinking about themselves taking shape.

## Inside the Sessions - What Happens in the Room

### Shitty First Drafts: Starting Imperfectly

Perfectionism silently kills most student projects before they start.

In **Shitty First Drafts**, we normalised starting messy:

- Students wrote their first “shitty” drafts of emails, pitches, or posts  
- We reviewed live, together  
- They saw how something rough could quickly turn into something strong with feedback and iteration  

By the end of the session, “Done > Perfect” wasn’t a quote on Instagram anymore; it was something they had personally experienced.

### Understanding Agency: How to Create Opportunities for Yourself

Most students are used to believing that:

- Opportunities come from college placements, or  
- From “someone they know”, or  
- From luck.

In **Understanding Agency**, we flipped that.

We walked them through stories, prompts, and workbook exercises that showed:

- What high-agency behaviour looks like in real life  
- How ordinary students have created their own opportunities  
- How “the mic” in life is almost never handed to you - you usually have to step up and take it  

You could see it land in real time when a student said (in the Zoom chat):

> “When you said nobody will hand you the mic in real life… that hit hard.”

### Agency in Action: Designing a Career That Works for You

In the follow-up session on **career design**, we took agency from idea to application.

Students mapped:

- The kind of work that energises them  
- The constraints they’re dealing with (family, finances, location)  
- The fears holding them back  
- The smallest possible next steps they could actually take this week  

For many, it was the first time someone had sat them down and said:

“You’re allowed to design your career intentionally. You don’t have to drift into the default option.”

### Navigating Your Future & Understanding System Design

In **Navigating Your Future**, we didn’t ask students for a five-year plan.  
We asked for something deeper: their honest emotions about the future.

- Some were anxious  
- Some were blank  
- Some were over-planners who panic when plans break  

We helped them see that the future is not a straight line; it’s a space to navigate with flexibility, awareness, and small, reversible bets.

In **Understanding System Design**, we zoomed out and showed them that:

- Grades don’t just depend on “studying hard” - they depend on sleep, stress, environment, support systems  
- Careers don’t just depend on a single decision - they depend on skills, networks, habits, and feedback loops  

Once students see their life as a **system** and not a random sequence, they gain something rare at that age: clarity.

## Kochi Camp: When the Room Filled Up

Then came the **TinkerHub Camp in Kochi**.

Over two days, we worked with **170+ students** in person. The room was full — students from different colleges, sitting with notebooks, workbooks, and a very visible mix of curiosity and scepticism on their faces.

By the end of the sessions on **Navigating the Future** and **System Design**, something shifted:

- More hands started going up  
- Students began sharing vulnerable, honest reflections  
- Groups started staying back to talk, ask questions, and continue exercises  

<div class="my-8 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
  <figure class="border border-slate-200 rounded-xl overflow-hidden dark:border-slate-800">

    <img src="/images/btb-camp-2.jpg" alt="Group photo of students and facilitators at Kochi camp" />
  </figure>
</div>

For many, this was the **first time** they experienced learning that felt:

- Emotionally safe  
- Intellectually demanding  
- Directly connected to their real lives  

That matters.

## Why This Work Matters for Kerala, and for India

There’s a reason this isn’t “just another program”.

The ground realities are sharp:

- A large percentage of engineering students in Kerala take **education loans**.  
- Only a fraction land **good jobs** straight out of college.  
- Many are technically capable, but struggle with:  
  - Decision-making  
  - Communication  
  - Confidence  
  - Taking initiative  
  - Thinking beyond “placement season”

On the other side, industries are changing faster than curricula. AI, automation, and new work models are reshaping what “employability” even means.

In that context, Beyond the Blueprint are not about teaching one more skill. They are about building **foundational traits**:

- **World-class employees**  
  - Reliable, responsible, able to think critically and creatively  
  - Able to see something through from start to finish  
- **World-beating entrepreneurs and makers**  
  - Awake to local problems  
  - Able to build contextually relevant solutions  
  - Ready to create opportunities, not just chase them  

Kerala - and India - don’t just need more certified graduates.  
We need **high-agency young people** who can learn, adapt, and build.

That’s the long game this work is playing.

## What Students Have Already Taught Us

Working with these students has also given us feedback about our own design:

- They value **honesty** over theatrics  
- They respond to **high expectations** if you treat them as equals  
- They want **practical structure**, not vague inspiration  
- They appreciate **punctuality, preparation, and professionalism** more than we expected  

One of the most meaningful pieces of feedback came after a scheduling mishap and rescheduled session, when a student said:

> “I’m here now because of the trust you built during the previous class. I tried harder to join because I knew this would be worth it. I wouldn’t do this for most other sessions.”

Trust is not on any impact dashboard.  
But for us, it’s the clearest possible indicator that we’re building something that matters.

## A Quick Founder Reflection

For both of us - Aruna and myself - this work is personal.

We grew up in an India where excellence often felt distant, imported, or unattainable. Through our experience, we have learned that it's a matter of upskilling, habits, mindsets and a bias toward consistent action.

That is the spirit we pour into every session.

We want a student in a small town in Kerala to feel, deep down:

- “My work can be world-class.”  
- “My ideas are not small.”  
- “My circumstances are real, but they are not the end of the story.”  

If Beyond the Blueprint can plant even a fraction of that belief in enough students, this entire effort is worth it.

---

## Where We Go from Here

This is what the next phase of Beyond the Blueprint looks like in our heads:

- **Weekly online sessions** that can eventually host 80–100 students at a time.  
- A growing library of **30+ sessions** across self-knowledge, career design, communication, and meta-thinking  
- **New topics launched every month**, based on real student needs  
- **In-person camps** like Kochi replicated across more locations  
- Collaborations with **domain experts, founders, and practitioners**  
- Experimenting with **AI-assisted workflows** in teaching. For eg. Scaling personalised feedback.  

The core product will remain the same: **A single, well-designed session that makes something click in a student’s mind and gives them tools to actually act on it.**
