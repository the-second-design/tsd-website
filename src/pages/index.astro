        Real World Ready is our flagship program for students and young professionals. It gives them structured
        practice in starting things, working with others, and making decisions about their future with intention.
        It often runs under co-branded names with partners, but the core promise is the same: move young people
        from passive consumption to doing real work in the real world.
